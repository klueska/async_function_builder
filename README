async_sim 1.0 - README
For questions or comments, please contact: Kevin Klues <klueska@cs.berkeley.edu>

This "application" is really just a header file that you can include to allow
you to "simulate" making calls asynchronously by spqwning of a pthread to do
your task and then joining on it later.  All of the 'hard' work is wrapped up
in macros for you, so you don't have to think about it.  Just add whatever
calls you'd like to make async to the top of the async_wrappers.h file (or
wherever you want, really), and you should be good to go.  The main.c file
simply demonstrates how to use the async calls themselves.
